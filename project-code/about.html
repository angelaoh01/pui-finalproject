          <h2>What We Believe</h2>
          <img src = "/pui-finalproject/assets/blood.JPG">
          <p>Central Church subscribes to the Reformed Tradition as outlined in the Westminster Standards. The entirety of our ministry flows from these biblical doctrines.</p>
          <h3>GOD IS TRIUNE</h3>
          <p>There is one God: infinite, eternal, almighty, unchangeable, and perfect in holiness, truth, and love. In the unity of the Godhead there are three Persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), the same in substance and equal in power and glory.</p>
          <h3>MANKIND</h3>
          <p>God made mankind, male and female, in his own image as the crown of creation. Tempted by Satan man rebelled against their Creator. In this fallen and sinful state, all mankind has become totally depraved and eternally deserving God's wrath, utterly incapable of returning to God, knowing God, and loving God apart from faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
          <h3>FAITH IN JESUS</h3>
          <p>Faith in Jesus Christ is a saving grace, by which we receive, rely, and rest on Jesus alone for salvation as he is freely offered to us in the Gospel. By placing our faith in Jesus, we are born again into newness of life and now live to follow him, obey him, and be conformed to him. This saving faith is God-given based on the Father's sovereign choice, not by our merit or foreseen faith.</p>
          <h3>THE CHURCH</h3>
          <p>The Church is the Bride of Christ who exists to glorify God by making disciples of all nations and teaching them to obey His commandments through the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
          <h3>THE SCRIPTURES</h3>
          <p>We accept the Bible, including the 39 books of the Old Testament and the 27 books of the New Testament, as the written and inspired Word of God. The Bible is God's infallible self-revelation to mankind. The Bible primarily and sufficiently teaches what man must believe about God and what God requires of man, and it leads us to salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
          <h3>JESUS CHRIST</h3>
          <p>Jesus Christ is the only begotten Son of God, the eternal Word made flesh, fully God and fully man, the image of the invisible God, and the only Savior for the sins of the world through his death and resurrection. Jesus will one day return in bodily, visible form to judge the world, gather his people, and make all things new.</p>
          <h3>HOLY SPIRIT</h3>
          <p>We believe the Holy Spirit, working through the word, supernaturally converts (regenerates) the hearts of Godâ€™s people by making alive what was spiritually dead. The Spirit convicts us of sin, leads us to repentance, causes us to grow in holiness, seals us for the day of redemption that we might be assured of our salvation, and equips us with spiritual gifts for the building up of the body.</p>
          <h3>THE GOSPEL</h3>
          <p>The Gospel is the Good News that God, in His gracious love, sent Jesus Christ to die on the cross and victoriously rise from the grave for those who place their faith in him, because otherwise they could not know God, earn God's love, or enter heaven in their darkened, depraved, sinful condition. Jesus' death on the cross is the one-time sacrifice that is sufficient for all-time; therefore, there is nothing we can contribute or need to contribute to our salvation </p>

          <h2>Our Vision</h2>
          <p>Central Church exists to make and mature disciples of Jesus Christ, so that the Gospel of Jesus Christ is the foundational principle through which we live in our homes, in our church, in our work, and in the city of Pittsburgh.</p>
